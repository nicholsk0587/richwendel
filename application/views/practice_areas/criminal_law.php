        <h2 id="drug">Drug Offenses</h2>
        <p>Any drug offense may have long-lasting effects.  It is imperative that you have experienced counsel to assist you.  Even a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge may involve significant collateral consequences affecting your ability to get a job or attend school.</p>
        <p>Drug Offenses include the illegal possession of, or trafficking in, controlled substances such as marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription medication.  Other offenses include illegal manufacture of drugs, cultivation of marihuana, illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, possession of drug paraphernalia, and permitting of drug abuse.</p>
        <p>Drug offenses frequently involve the misuse of prescription medication, including deception to obtain dangerous drugs, illegal processing of drug documents, forgery, and tampering with drugs.</p>
        <p>Significant penalties may be associated in drug offenses, and vary dramatically based on the type and quantity of the drug involved.  Penalties include lengthy mandatory prison terms, large fines, treatment requirements, property forfeitures, and drivers' license suspensions.</p>
        <p>It is imperative that you seek assistance if you or a loved-one has been charged with a drug offense, whether it is misdemeanor drug possession or felony drug trafficking.  Frequently the abuse of drugs is related to addiction, and the existence of mitigating factors should be explored in evaluating a matter.  Rich Wendel has years of experience in helping individuals charged with drug offenses, both through aggressively challenging the charges and in assisting with problems associated with drug addiction.</p>
        <h3>Before Charges are Brought</h3>
        <p>If you believe that you are the target of a criminal investigation you should exercise your rights and seek the advice of a reputable attorney.  You will always benefit from a consultation and review of your matter before being subjected to interrogations or other law enforcement investigation or testing.</p>
        <p>Even if you believe your potential criminal exposure is low or that criminal charges are unlikely, a thorough and confidential consultation can help guide you in this stressful and potentially life-altering situation.</p>
        <p>Seemingly innocent actions or words may be misinterpreted and lead to misunderstandings and criminal charges. Ensure that your side of the story is properly understood and, when appropriate, communicated to law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Your consultation with an attorney may ultimately enable counsel to negotiate a more favorable resolution of your matter with the police and prosecutors.  It may lead to less serious charges being brought against you or even with an agreed resolution before a criminal complaint is even filed.  More importantly, it may lead to criminal charges never being filed at all.</p>
        <p>Call Rich Wendel today for a confidential consultation and review of your matter.</p>

        <h2 id="domestic">Domestic Violence</h2>
        <p>
        Most law enforcement agencies have a &quot;must arrest&quot; policy on emergency calls involving domestic violence.  In other words, someone is going to jail to let the situation calm down, and law enforcement will likely request a court to issue a temporary protection order prohibiting contact between the parties even though no conviction has occurred.</p>
        <p>The charged individual may be excluded from the marital residence and prohibited from any and all personal or electronic communication with the family or household member, including children and others not involved in the case at all.  Some courts may further require the use of electronic monitoring devices while the matter is pending.  A violation of a protection order is a separate and additional criminal offense.</p>
        <p>Domestic violence is the physical or verbal abuse that occurs among family or household members.  This may include spouses, children, parents, boyfriends and girlfriends.  It may involve a pattern of abusive behavior or a single, isolated incident.</p>
        <p>Domestic violence laws are well-intentioned and designed to separate the parties and protect the peace.  However, because of the strict arrest policies, the domestic violence laws are often abused by individuals &quot;gaming&quot; the system in order to obtain a favorable position in domestic relations or custody matters.  A mere argument or disagreement may be turned into a serious charge with long-lasting consequences.
        </p>
        <h3>Penalties</h3>
        <p>In Ohio, most domestic violence matters are charged as misdemeanors.  However, individuals with prior domestic violence convictions are subject to increasing levels of felony charges.</p>
        <p>The collateral consequences of domestic violence convictions should also not be discounted.  Convicted individuals are prohibited from owning or possessing firearms, and may be subject to discipline or discharge from their employers.  Many professions including police and emergency fire may simply be unavailable to those convicted of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>If you or a loved one has been charged with domestic violence, contact Rich Wendel at (513)632-5317 for an evaluation of the matter.</p>

        <h2 id="expunge">Expungement/Sealing of the Record</h2>
        <p>An offense occurring years ago may simply be embarrassing or may be a serious impediment to employment or educational opportunities.  In today's electronic and information society, access to an individual's prior history and criminal record has never been greater.  In Ohio, if you qualify as a &quot;first offender,&quot; you may be eligible to have the record of your conviction sealed or &quot;expunged.&quot;</p>
        <p>Individuals with a misdemeanor conviction generally must wait one year from the date of discharge to file an application to seal the record, while individuals with a felony must wait three years.  Some convictions may not be expunged, including OVI/DUI offenses and felonies that include a mandatory term of incarceration.</p>
        <p>For an evaluation of your expungment matter and a determination of whether you are eligible contact the Law Offices of Richard G. Wendel, II at (513)632-5317.</p>
