        <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Disputes</h2>
        <p>Frequently the primary issue is not whether someone is legally responsible for negligence, but whether there is insurance coverage that will provide protection for the damage caused.  An insurance policy is, at its core, a contract between the insurer and the policy holder.  The interpretation of this contract is frequently in dispute in many different contexts.</p>
        <p>At the Law Office of Richard G. Wendel, II we are well-versed in insurance law, whether it is in context of an automotive claim for underinsured or uninsured motorists coverage; a homeowner's claim for water damage due to sewerage backup, or a commercial claim due to wind and storm damage to a business location.</p>
        <p>Frequently, disputes between policy holders and insurance companies are resolved through litigation known as a declaratory judgment action.  In essence, a policy holder who believes he or she is entitled to a defense or coverage and indemnity protection may bring a lawsuit against his or her insurance company and ask a court to determine the legal contractual rights and obligations between the parties.</p>
        <p>Contact the Law Offices of Richard G. Wendel, II at (513)632-5317 to schedule a consultation to discuss your insurance matter.</p>
