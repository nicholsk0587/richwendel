    <h1>Kentucky DUI/OVI</h1>
    <p>In Kentucky, the offense of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or a Controlled Substance is denoted as &#8220;DUI.&#8221;  Persons charged with DUI should seek legal counsel immediately in order to ensure that their rights and interests are properly and fully protected.
 </p>
    <p> A successful defense against such a charge involves a thorough investigation, a critical review of the subjective claims of law enforcement, evaluation of police adherence to constitutional standards, and understanding the interaction of statutory law with court procedure and administrative rules.  </p>
    <p>Kentucky DUI applies to both alcohol and other substances.  KRS section 189A.010 prohibits individuals from operating or being in physical control of a motor vehicle while being under the influence of alcohol, while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, while being under the influence of any other substance which impairs one&#8217;s driving ability, or while the presence of a controlled substance is detected in the blood by a test taken within two hours of the cessation of operation or physical control of a motor vehicle.  </p>
